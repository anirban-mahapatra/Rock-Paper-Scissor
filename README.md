## Overview
### The Challenge
The challenge was to create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Java. The game is played against the computer. The player and the computer both have to choose one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game continues for 5 rounds, and the one with the highest score at the end wins.

## My Process
### Built With
- Java
- Java's Scanner class for user input
- Java's Random class for generating computer's choice

### What I Learned
I learned how to use Java's Scanner and Random classes effectively. I also learned how to implement game logic in Java.

### Continued Development
In the future, I plan to add more features to this game, such as:
- Allowing the user to decide the number of rounds
- Adding a graphical user interface

### Useful Resources
